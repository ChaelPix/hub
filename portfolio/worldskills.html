                        <p>The competition, in team of 2, was made of 4 trials:
                        <br><br> - A sand course where we were forbidden to use caterpillar tracks on the robot.
                        <br> - A little maze without external walls.
                        <br> - A sloppy ramp.
                        <br> - Completing the 3 courses in a row.
                        <br><br> For each trial, the robot had a water cup to deliver to a random colored cup located at the end of the track with a claw.

                        <p>The competition lasts 3 days. We built 2 robots, one for the sand course and the other one for the other courses.
                        <br> I programmed the robots with C++ for Arduino.

                        <br> I wasn't expected to participate to this competition. Indeed, I was originally a volounteer to help to present the skill
                        <br> of mobile robotics. But, in the morning of the competition, a competitor abandoned and didn't come. 
                        I had the opportunity to replace him. 
                        <br> <br> So, I had a go, and learnt everything during the 3 days of competition then won a Silver Medal!

                        <p>The competition was about a storage factory simulation.
                        <br>
                        <br> In a 4*2m area with walls. The robot has to navigate on the board to stamp boxes identified by Qr Code.
                        <br> For this competition, I didn't use Arduino, but I had to learn by myself ROS (robot operating system). Indeed, this operating system 
                        <br> is optimized for controlling robots and helped me to use the Lidar for the localization of the robot on 
                        <br> the board. It's a powerful tool with a big community.
                        <br>
                        <br> Despite some unexpected hardware issues, we finished 2nd with a silver medal.
                        <br>
                        <br> However, since we had already learnt ROS and showed that we we're very passionated, motivated and had more knowledge than gold 
                        <br> medal winners, we had been choosen in the <u><b>French Team</b> for the <b>Worlds</b>! </u>
