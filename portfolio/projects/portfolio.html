                This portfolio was created to showcase my projects and highlight my skills using Tailwind CSS. 
                The goal is to allow visitors to quickly identify the technologies I have worked with by labeling each project. 
                This way, people can easily filter for the technologies they are interested in and view the relevant projects. 
                Additionally, it motivates me to develop more projects and expand my collection of project cards.

            <p class="mt-4 text-center">
                Each card is generated from a JSON object containing the project data like:

                I chose not to use a generic template for the projects, as most of them are unique. Instead, I load a custom .html file to display each project in a popup, such as portfolio.html in this case.
