            For my robot, I have to understand Inverse Kinematics to grab objects in a 3d space.

            So I developed with C++ an algorithm to solve the inverse kinematics problem for a chain of segments using a geometric approach based on circle intersections. This algorithm allows the robot to accurately position its end effector at a desired location within its workspace.

                The algorithm solves the inverse kinematics problem for a chain of segments using a geometric approach based on circle intersections:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside  mt-4 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <strong>Distance and Validity Check:</strong> The end effector's position is checked to ensure it lies within the chain's maximum reach. If it exceeds the limit, the target is scaled to the maximum reachable distance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intersection of Circles:</strong> Each segment is modeled as a circle with its radius equal to the segment length. The algorithm computes intersection points between these circles by:
                    <ul class="list-decimal list-inside ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Using the law of cosines to determine the overlap distance.</li>
                        <li>Calculating a perpendicular vector for the height of the triangle formed by the centers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Triangle Validation:</strong> A helper function ensures that the lengths of the triangle sides formed by the segment being solved and its neighbors respect the triangle inequality, ensuring physically valid configurations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Iterative Backward Resolution:</strong> Starting from the end effector, the algorithm calculates each joint's position backward toward the base by resolving circle intersections.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pole Constraint:</strong> The algorithm stabilizes the chain by choosing the intersection point closer to a pole, which acts as an external constraint. This ensures smoother and predictable movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Real-Time Interaction:</strong> The algorithm dynamically updates the chain configuration in response to user input, such as moving the end effector or adjusting the pole position with the mouse.
                </li>
            </ul>
