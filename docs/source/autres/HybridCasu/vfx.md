# Advanced Graphics Optimization Framework for Hybrid-Casual Puzzle Games  

## VFX Implementation Guidelines  

### Particle System Parameters  
1. **Performance Thresholds**  
   - **Mobile-Safe Particle Limits**  
     - 2D Puzzles: ≤150 particles/effect (e.g., match explosions)  
     - 3D Elements: ≤300 particles/effect (e.g., cascading tile breaks)  
     - Background FX: ≤50 particles/effect (e.g., ambient sparkles)  

   Use **texture atlases** (1024x1024 max) combining 4-8 particle sprites[1][6]. Implement LOD systems that reduce particle counts by:  
   - 50% when >5m from camera in 3D games  
   - 30% for off-screen particles in 2D games  

2. **Shader Optimization Protocol**  
   - **Vertex Shaders**: 15-20 instructions max  
   - **Fragment Shaders**: 25-30 instructions max  
   - Avoid real-time lighting calculations - bake illumination into textures  

   Example: Tile highlight effect using:  
   ```glsl  
   void main() {  
     vec4 texColor = texture2D(u_Texture, v_TexCoordinate);  
     float glow = sin(u_Time * 5.0) * 0.3 + 0.7;  
     gl_FragColor = texColor * vec4(glow, glow, 1.0, 1.0);  
   }  
   ```
   (12 instructions, 2 texture samples)[1][4]  

### Screen Shake Implementation Matrix  

| Event Type        | Shake Profile             | Duration | Intensity | Use Case |  
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------|----------|  
| Perfect Combo     | Vertical + Rotation       | 400ms    | 0.8-1.2g  | 3+ chain matches |  
| Critical Failure  | Horizontal Sawtooth      | 600ms    | 1.5-2.0g  | 5+ failed attempts |  
| Epic Win          | Zoom Burst (0.9→1.1x)    | 300ms    | N/A       | Chapter completion |  
| Error Feedback    | Horizontal Microshake    | 100ms    | 0.3g      | Invalid move |  

**Implementation Rules:**  
- Never exceed 2.5g acceleration (causes motion sickness)  
- Cap cumulative shake time at 1.2s/minute[5]  
- Use directional shakes matching action vectors (e.g., shake left when tile slides right)

## Haptic Feedback Design  

### Tactile Event Schedule  

| Interaction       | Haptic Pattern          | Duration | iOS Strength | Android Effect |  
|--------------------|-------------------------|----------|--------------|----------------|  
| Tile Selection     | Light Tap               | 15ms     | 0.3          | CLICK          |  
| Match Success      | Double Pulse            | 40ms     | 0.7          | DOUBLE_CLICK   |  
| Combo Chain        | Rising Burst (3 pulses)| 120ms    | 1.0→0.5      | TICK           |  
| Error              | Sharp Buzz              | 80ms     | 0.9          | HEAVY_CLICK    |  

**Accessibility Requirements:**  
- Provide separate toggles for:  
  - Gameplay haptics  
  - UI feedback haptics  
  - Narrative event haptics[2]  

- Default settings must pass:  
  - 50% reduced intensity for battery saver mode  
  - Automatic disable when system-wide haptics off  

---

## Visual Perception Balancing  

### Contrast and Readability Standards  
1. **Text/UI Elements**  
   - Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)  
   - Stroke width: 2-3% of element height  
   - Drop shadow opacity: 30-40%  

2. **Puzzle Elements**  
   - Hue variance: ≥30° on color wheel  
   - Value difference: ≥40% between active/inactive states  
   - Size differentiation: ≥15% for interactive vs. static elements  

**Dynamic Adaptation:**  
```  
if (ambientLight > 500 lux) {  
  boostSaturation(20%);  
  increaseEdgeContrast(15%);  
}  
```
(Implement via light sensor or manual toggle)[3][6]

## Performance Preservation Techniques  

### Memory Budget Allocation  

| Component         | 2D Game Budget | 3D Game Budget |  
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|  
| Textures           | ≤45MB          | ≤80MB          |  
| Mesh Data          | ≤15MB          | ≤35MB          |  
| Animation          | ≤8MB           | ≤20MB          |  
| VFX Assets         | ≤12MB          | ≤25MB          |  

**Optimization Strategies:**  
- ASTC 4x4 texture compression (save 60-70% VRAM)  
- Mesh LODs with 50%/30%/15% triangle counts  
- 15fps animation baking for distant objects[6]  

---

## User Experience Thresholds  

### Sensory Overload Prevention  
1. **Simultaneous FX Limits**  
   - Max 3 particle systems active  
   - Max 1 screen shake + 2 haptic events  

2. **Visual Event Density**  
   - 2-3 significant FX/minute in early game  
   - 5-7 FX/minute in late-game intensity peaks  

3. **Cognitive Load Management**  
   - 7±2 interactive elements per puzzle screen  
   - 5±2 active UI indicators  

**Burnout Protection:**  
- After 45 minutes continuous play:  
  - Reduce particle counts by 20%  
  - Desaturate colors by 15%  
  - Increase puzzle solve time by 10%  

---

## Quality Assurance Checklist  

### Playtest Metrics  
1. **First-Time User Experience**  
   - 85%+ success rate on initial 5 puzzles  
   - ≤2% confusion-induced exits  

2. **Session Flow**  
   - 40-60 second average interaction bursts  
   - 3-5 minute natural break points  

3. **Performance Benchmarks**  
   - ≤2% frame drops below 30fps  
   - ≤50MB memory fluctuation  

**Iteration Protocol:**  
- A/B test FX variants with:  
  - 50-user cohorts  
  - EEG/GSR biometric sampling  
  - 48-hour cool-off periods between tests

By implementing these exacting specifications, you create a sensory experience that feels polished and premium while maintaining buttery-smooth performance. The key is treating VFX and haptics as narrative devices rather than gratuitous effects - each vibration and particle burst should directly communicate game state or reward value. Remember: mobile players judge quality through tactile responsiveness as much as visual flair.
