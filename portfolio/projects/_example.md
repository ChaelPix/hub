# Snake Game - Classic Arcade Revival

## Overview

A modern take on the classic Snake game, built with smooth animations and responsive controls. This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts and collision detection algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Smooth Movement**: Fluid snake movement with configurable speed
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score updates and high score storage
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Visual Effects**: Particle effects and smooth animations

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Language** | JavaScript (ES6+) |
| **Graphics** | HTML5 Canvas |
| **Styling** | CSS3 with animations |
| **Build** | Webpack |

## Game Mechanics

### Core Logic
```javascript
function updateSnake() {
    const head = {x: snake[0].x + dx, y: snake[0].y + dy};
    
    // Check collision with walls
    if (head.x < 0 || head.x >= boardWidth || 
        head.y < 0 || head.y >= boardHeight) {
        gameOver();
        return;
    }
    
    snake.unshift(head);
    
    // Check if food eaten
    if (head.x === food.x && head.y === food.y) {
        score += 10;
        generateFood();
    } else {
        snake.pop();
    }
}
```

### Collision Detection
The game implements efficient collision detection for:
- **Wall boundaries**: Prevents snake from leaving the game area
- **Self-collision**: Detects when snake hits its own body
- **Food collection**: Triggers growth and score increase

## Development Process

### Initial Planning
- Sketched game flow and state management
- Designed modular architecture for easy expansion
- Planned responsive controls for touch devices

### Implementation Highlights
1. **Canvas Optimization**: Used requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering
2. **Touch Controls**: Added swipe gestures for mobile compatibility
3. **State Management**: Clean separation between game logic and rendering

## Performance Optimizations

> **Memory Management**: Implemented object pooling for food particles to reduce garbage collection overhead.

- Efficient canvas clearing and redrawing
- Optimized collision detection algorithms
- Reduced DOM manipulations

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Multiplayer Mode**: Local co-op snake battles
- [ ] **Power-ups**: Special food items with unique effects
- [ ] **Themes**: Different visual themes and environments
- [ ] **Leaderboard**: Online high score tracking
