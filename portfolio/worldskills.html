                        <b><h4>I'm a Worlskills Competitor in Autonomous Mobile Robotics selected for the French Team for the WORLDS 2024.</h4></b>
                        <p>
                        All begins with the regional competition, in teams of 2. We had 4 trials:
                        <br><br> - A sand course where we were forbidden to use caterpillar tracks on the robot.
                        <br> - a little maze without external walls.
                        <br> - a sloppy ramp.
                        <br> - completing the 3 courses in a row.
                        <br><br> For each trial, the robot had a water cup to deliver to a random colored cup located at the end of the track with a claw.

                        <p>The competition lasts 3 days. We built 2 robots, one for the sand course and the other one for the other courses.
                        <br> I programmed the robots with C++ for Arduino.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <br> I wasn't expected to participate to this competition. Indeed, I was originally a volunteer to help to present the skill
                        <br> of mobile robotics. But, in the morning of the competition, a competitor abandoned and didn't come. 
                        I had the opportunity to replace him. 
                        <br> <br> So, I had a go, and learnt everything during the 3 days of competition, then won a Silver Medal!

                        <p>The competition was about a storage factory simulation.
                            <br>
                            <br> In a 4*2m area with walls. The robot has to navigate on the board to stamp boxes identified by QR code.
                            <br> For this competition, I didn't use Arduino, but I had to learn ROS1 (robot operating system) by myself. Indeed, this operating system 
                            <br> is optimised for controlling robots and helped me use the Lidar for the localization of the robot on 
                            <br> the board. It's a powerful tool with a big community.
                            <br>
                            <br> Despite some unexpected hardware issues, we finished 2nd with a silver medal.
                            <br>
                            <br> However, since we had already learnt ROS1 and showed that we're very passionate, motivated, and had more potential than gold 
                            <br> medal winners, we had been chosen for the <u><b>French Team</b> for the <b>Worlds</b>! </u>

                        <p> A few weeks after having been picked for the French Team, we had the opportunity to
                        <br> participate as a country guest in Austria's national competition.
                        <br> 
                        <br> For this competition and the worlds' one, we have to use a new robot kit from Studica.
                        <br> So we had to learn how to use the studica's libraries and migrate our knowledge about ROS1 to ROS2.
                        <br>
                        <br> The competition was about localization and picking objects.
                        <br>
                        <br> In a 4*2m area with walls. The robot has to navigate on the board only with ultrasonic and InfraRed sensors.
                        <br> This competition was an opportunity to test our new tools, like our Docker, our programme systems, and so on.
                        <br>
                        <br> We had 3 intense days where we learnt a lot of things that will help us in our Worlds' competition preparation.
