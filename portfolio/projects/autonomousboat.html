                Introduction
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-center">
                I wanted to delve the algorithms and process of computer vision without using high level libraries/tools such as YOLO.
                Thus, I created a simulation in Unity where I stream the camera on a web page to independently process the image with Python.
                The simulation recreates a day/nigh cycle, the camera is mounted on a boat and the quality of the image is reduced to simulate a low quality camera. At night, there is a light source on the boat to have a minimum of visibility.

                My goal is to detect the obstacles such as boats, animals, island and so on, and to avoid them. However, in this project I'm not focussing on having quick results, but rather learning the process and mathematics behind the computer vision filters, tools...

            <p class="mt-4 text-center">
                So, first I started with the basics, detecting the horizon line on the water surface. I learnt to use the Hough transform to detect lines in an image. I also used the Canny edge detection algorithm to detect the edges of the image. I then used the Hough transform to detect the horizon line on the water surface.
                I added some smoothing to avoid the line jumping.

                 Obstacle detection : Bounding Box using line contours.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-4 text-center">
                Now I want to learn how to detect obstacles. There are different methods to do this, I will start by learning the bounding box method using the contours of the lines. My process:

            <ul class="list-disc w-2/3 mx-auto mt-4 text-left space-y-2">
                <li>Converting the image to grayscale to reduce the number of channels to process; instead of 3 channels (RGB), only 1 channel (grayscale).</li>
                <li>Applying a canny edge detection algorithm to detect the edges of the image.</li>
                <li>Using a dilatation algorithm in canny to thicken the edges of the image. This helps avoid missing some edges.</li>
                <li>Transforming to a binary image (only white and black) to highlight the object contours.</li>
                <li>Using the line contours algorithm from OpenCV and drawing it on the frame.</li>
                <li>Finally, drawing boxes around the contours to create a ROI (region of interest) of the obstacle.</li>
            </ul>

            However, we can see that the horizon line is merged to the contours, thus the bounding box is covering every obstacle.
            I then tried the Harris Corner Detection and saw that it was working better than the contours line method.
