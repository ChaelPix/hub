                        <p>The competition, in team of 2, was made of 3 different courses:
                        <br><br> - First one was a sand course where we were forbidden to use caterpillar tracks on the robot.
                        <br> - The 2nd one was a little maze.
                        <br> - And the last one was a sloppy ramp.
                        <br><br> The robot had to pass through the courses to deliver water to a random colored cup located at the end of the track.

                        <p>The competition lasts 3 days. We built 2 robots, one for the sand course and the other one for the other courses.
                        <br> I programmed the robots with C++ for Arduino.

                        <br> I wasn't expected to participate to this competition. Indeed, I was originally a volounteer to help to present the skill
                        <br> of mobile robotics. But, in the morning of the competition, a competitor abandoned and didn't come. 
                        I had the opportunity to replace him. 
                        <br> <br> So, I had a go, and learnt everything during the 3 days of competition then won a Silver Medal!
